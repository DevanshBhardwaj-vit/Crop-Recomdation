# Crop-Recomdation
Link is given below
The main aim of the above project is to suggest farmers the most suitable crop for their land based on the ML model

We have used Random Forest to Classify the Crops on the basis of input provided

#Random Forest Classifier:
The algorithm merges the outputs of numerous decision trees to produce a single outcome based on the majority decision of the decision tree (Boosting algorithm) is used to divide the dataset into many simple tree and the output of each tree is averaged out to find the result.
